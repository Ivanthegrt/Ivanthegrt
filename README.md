## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ§‘ My name is Ivan, and I'm hoping to start a career in software development! 
- ðŸš€ My journey in the art of computer science began last year, after I enrolled in edX's free CS50 course.
  Upon finishing the course, I decided to continue my work on it's final project
  and bring it to the Android Play Store, with the intention of gaining practical experience while
  learning, exploring, and reinforcing computational concepts from class and anew.
- ðŸ”¬ I'm currently working on an encrypted storage application in native Android, focusing on efficient,
  readable and maintainable code.
- â˜• For my project I've taken the more modern Kotlin, Jetpack Compose approach, implementing elegant design and clean architecture concepts
  as I learn.
- ðŸ“¨ Contact me to test my app in the play store! you can
  reach me at: ihnetr.1@gmail.com
