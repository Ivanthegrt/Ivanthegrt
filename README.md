## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ§‘ My name is Ivan, and I'm hoping to switch careers into a sofware related field. 
- ðŸš€ My journey in the art of computer science began last year, after I enrolled in Edx's free CS50 course.
  Immediately after finishing that course I decided to continue my work on that course's final project
  and bring it to the Android Play Store, with the intention of gaining practical experience while
  learning, exploring, and reinforcing computational concepts from class and anew.
- ðŸ”¬ I'm currently working on an encrypted storage application in native Android, focusing on efficient,
  readable and maintainable code. It has been through my own experience developing this app that it's quickly
  dawned on me the crucial importance of readable, well commented, and testable code. I've come to
  realize that, when the inevitable new feature, bug fix, or redesign comes, readable, maintainable code makes
  all the difference.
- â˜• For my project I've taken a full Kotlin, Jetpack Compose approach, implementing elegant design and clean
  compose concepts as well as utilizing the viewmodel for storing UI states and handling all business operations.
  I believe Jetpack compose is a much cleaner and concise approach to the UI, as opposed to XML layouts, and I
  think once comfortable enough it's much easier to work with.
- ðŸ“¨ Feel free to contact me to take part in my closed internal testing of my app in the play store! you can
